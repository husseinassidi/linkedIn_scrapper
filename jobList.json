      "Job_Description": "Job DescriptionBackgroundCorruption undercuts countries’ efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It wastes valuable resources, reduces government effectiveness, erodes trust in public institutions, distorts markets, stifles innovation, deepens inequalities, damages the environment, and increases vulnerability to crises and conflicts. Driven by country priorities across the Arab states region and recognizing the critical importance of governance, which is one of UNDP’s “signature solutions” under its new Strategic Plan (2022-2025), UNDP adopted a regional approach to support and facilitate measurable progress towards transparency and accountability. This approach optimizes the use of scarce technical resources, enables agile and swift responses in a rapidly changing environment, mitigates risks of politicization and allows for accelerated and tailored exchanges of expertise among peers drawing on commonalities among the countries of the region.UNDP’s regional project on Anti-Corruption and Integrity in Arab Countries (ACIAC) contributes to the Strategic Plan’s “direction of change” including structural transformations, leaving no one behind, and building resilience by targeting the achievement of the three outputs outlined in this annual work plan. Related planned activities for 2024 are funded by the Government of the Republic of Korea. Primary recipients of the support are stakeholders across the region with a priority given to Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, and Tunisia. The regional team also provides support to additional countries through its advisory services to the various Country Offices in the Arab States region.In 2024, the focus of the regional project is on the inclusive and effective implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), including through policy and legislative support, training, and the provision of technologies and other tools to boost capacities of concerned institutions. It is also significantly expanding the work on transparency and accountability in key vulnerable sector, including through new research and the development and deployment of sectoral tools to identify, assess and mitigate risks of corruption. In addition, the focus in 2024 is strengthening collective action capacities to advocate for the achievement of SDG16, including through the Arab Anti-Corruption and Integrity Network (ACINET), while fostering sustainable capacity development on related topics through specialized academies, training centers and universities in the project countries.Accordingly, UNDP is seeking to recruit an intern for its regional project on Anti-Corruption and Integrity in Arab Countries (ACIAC) to support its analytical research and outreach activities on issues pertaining to anti-corruption, rule of law, and democratic governance trends and developments in the Arab region and worldwide. The intern will also support the regional project in implementing its activities as well as related communications with partners, beneficiaries and stakeholders and perform related administrative tasks as needed. The intern will be under the supervision of the Regional Chief Technical Advisor and Project Manager or his/her designated representative(s).Duties And ResponsibilitiesThe intern will be based in Beirut, Lebanon. Under the supervision of the Regional Chief Technical Advisor and Project Manager or his/her designated representative(s), responsibilities may include, but will not be limited to, the following:Undertake research and drafting tasks as required on issues pertaining to anti-corruption, rule of law, and democratic governance trends and developments in the Arab region and worldwide.

      "Job_Description": "Job DescriptionBackgroundMore than 60 percent of the Arab region’s population is under the age of 30. Harnessing the energy of youth has the potential to build peace and stability and expand economic opportunities for them and their countries. However, unlocking these possibilities for young people requires partnership among all stakeholders, including youth themselves as well as a whole-of-society approach that widens participation and inclusion of youth in all aspects of life. In this age of complexity, the transition required is systemic and solutions need to be adaptable and holistic with a long-term vision. In response, UNDP has developed a shared agenda, a Regional Youth Project, SHABABEEK, to promote young people’s empowerment by building their capabilities and creating access to opportunities for engagement.Bringing together governments, private sector partners, civil society and young people, the Regional Youth Team works with 17 Country Offices in the Arab region, focusing on initiatives, projects and interventions directly supporting youth in the region under the two outcome areas of Economic, and Political and Civic Empowerment.As part of the project, a virtual space in the form of a digital platform, the NextGen Youth Platform, was created to bring together different elements of the youth innovation ecosystem. The platform bridges youths, national partners including youth serving organizations, donors, incubators, policymakers, academia, external stakeholders and individuals.

      "Job_Description": "Job DescriptionBackgroundDiversity, Equity and Inclusion are core principles at UNDP: we value diversity as an expression of the multiplicity of nations and cultures where we operate, we foster inclusion as a way of ensuring all personnel are empowered to contribute to our mission, and we ensure equity and fairness in all our actions. Taking a ‘leave no one behind’ approach to our diversity efforts means increasing representation of underserved populations. People who identify as belonging to marginalized or excluded populations are strongly encouraged to apply. Learn more about working at UNDP including our values and inspiring stories.UNDP does not tolerate sexual exploitation and abuse, any kind of harassment, including sexual harassment, and discrimination. All selected candidates will, therefore, undergo rigorous reference and background checks.Lebanon is still going through one of the worst economic crises in its modern history. Since October 2019, the economy has shrunk by more than 39.9%, with GDP dropping from US$54.9 billion in 2018 to an estimated US$23 billion in 2022. This has led to a significant decrease in GDP per capita, falling from $9,225 in 2018 to an estimated $3,303 in 2022 [1] .The brutal economic collapse has had severe social and humanitarian consequences, disproportionally affecting vulnerable groups especially women and youth. Vulnerable groups including women, youth among others have been bearing the brunt of the crisis: women unemployment rates reached as high as 32% [2] , exacerbating the existing gender gap.UNDP Lebanon is implementing a comprehensive approach that would foster women equal access to resources, tools and economic opportunities (markets) that would enable them to do business better, while making sure that institutions (public and private) are more responsive to women’s needs and are able to provide them with the needed tools, systems and opportunities to be the main drivers of their economic success and empowerment. Emphasis will be put on supporting the most vulnerable women to improve their economic opportunities and their access to and control over productive assets and income.By supporting women access to economic opportunities, the project will be supporting job stabilization as well as job creation directly and indirectly, thus contributing to poverty reduction. More specifically, by providing women with the tools to compete nationally and internationally, and by ensuring they are prepared i.e. their products and services have the needed quality to enter markets and generate opportunities, the project will ensure that women-led businesses can continuously generate the needed income to grow and sustain livelihood, thus contributing to poverty reduction. Furthermore, the various skills trainings provided for women in will also bridge the gap between the supply and the demand sides of the job market, thus directly supporting target beneficiaries in accessing employment.___________________________________________________________[1] World Bank Data[2] ILO and Central Administration of Statistics, Lebanon follow-up Labour Force Survey January 2022.Duties And ResponsibilitiesUnder the guidance and supervision of the Project Manager and the Economist, the Research Associate will support the effective implementation of Women’s Economic Empowerment Through Advancing Women-Led Enterprises in Lebanon project through focusing on the below work streams:Support in conducting Socio-Economic Research Contribute to background research relevant for the project mainly the collection of socio-economic data as well as productive sectors indicators which will be relevant for the short-listing of economic sectors that will form the basis of the intervention.

We are well known in tech circles as the publisher of Ubuntu, the preferred OS for cloud computing, containers, software engineering and AI/ML data science. With almost every team remote by default, Canonical sets the pace on the 21st-century digital workplace. We're small for a platform vendor, but profitable. Our goal is to be the world's best, not biggest, global software company.This is an opportunity for a person with outstanding leadership, organisation and intellect, to build our Organisational Development team that develops and harmonises our management practices. We are now 1,000+ colleagues across 70+ countries. We would like to create a new team to focus on organisational development - specifically to deepen our insights and effectiveness as a remote-first and globally distributed organisation.The whole world had a taste of remote work in 2020-21, and it has become a source of fascination and debate in business circles. We want to be the best in the world at it. We deeply believe that our mission is best served by hiring people evenly across the globe who are themselves highly motivated by that mission. However, we know that being effective remotely requires discipline and good habits, and we would like to invest in the research needed to understand that, the training and policymaking which enable it, and the selection mechanisms that ensure consistency of behaviours. We'd like to understand what really makes a distributed, remote-first workplace work. We think we're pretty good at this, remote-first for almost 20 years, but we know there is a lot still to understand, and the frontier of possibility continues to move outward.

      "Job_Location": "Beirut, Beirut Governorate, Lebanon Be among the first 25 applicants",
      "Job_Description": "Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few office based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.The company is founder led, profitable and growing.We are hiring IoT Sales Representatives to expand our reach in mission-critical industries such as Automotive, Medical Devices, Industrial Systems, Robotics, and Telco, as well as consumer electronics. We are looking for candidates who are technically skilled and familiar with embedded Linux and RTOS. We are expanding in all time zones, so we can accommodate candidates from almost any country as long as they have reasonable business access to a substantial market territory in person. As we grow our teams we will also hire Sales Team Managers and Regional Sales Directors, please continue with this process if your goal is a management leadership position.The server edition of Ubuntu is already very widely used in connected devices and industrial PC's. Our newer edition of Ubuntu for IoT, called Ubuntu Core, represents the state of the art in security and resilience for high end appliances and equipment. Our customers include global brands in consumer and industrial electronics as well as automotive and robotics. We continue to expand our range of offerings to bring our security, management and developer experience to the smallest Linux environments and devices. We recently added a real-time Linux capability and are working towards a range of certifications for these offerings. Together, this portfolio is Linux reinvented for optimal reliability, security, developer productivity and footprint.This is a prospecting sales and strategic account development role and requires energy, ambition and focus. In order to be successful, you must be comfortable positioning and selling open source, services, and software solutions to all levels of an organization, and specifically to departments that are developing embedded software and IoT devices. You should also be familiar with at least one of our priority sectors.Customers love the idea that they can get security compliance and support for everything open source from a single company. Our goal is to have more solutions on tap than any other vendor, and we have built unique capabilities to make that possible across every cloud, every class of compute and every category of application. Canonical provides licensed enterprise software products, commercial support, managed services, consulting and training services to customers who are deploying Ubuntu or open source applications on the cloud, in their data center, or to the connected device and IoT ecosystem. We are $250m in revenue, profitable, on a steady but relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote and ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not biggest, enterprise software company.We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a rush to find a position, it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long term advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world leading company we select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an environment which promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.In building our sales team, we look for five things:Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problemsHigh intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidencePassion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizesTeamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitionsEnergy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customersUbuntu is already very widely adopted which gives us a credible basis for conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable commercial relationships with brands in their territory. Our product managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop the potential of your territory. You will need judgement as to which industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest. We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as clear, complete and continuous reporting on pipeline status and activity, using standard professional tools.The successful candidate will carry an annual bookings quota within their assigned territory. They should be able to travel regionally for client engagement, industry conferences, and internationally for company events twice a year. They will be expected to demonstrate professionalism and effectiveness, to prospect accounts for new business, maintain and develop existing relationships, and work with colleagues and partners on account strategy. They must be comfortable selling enterprise software, open source, cloud, virtualization, container technologies and technical software solutions to senior levels of the enterprise.Location: We are growing our sales reach in all regions - EMEA, APAC and Americas.What your day will look likeBuild and execute a territory plan to prioritise leading security-focused brands and manufacturersWork with marketing to promote our brand and increase market awareness in prioritized accountsDevelop pipeline through outreach, prospecting, local marketing, and industry eventsClose contracts to meet and exceed quarterly and annual bookings targets and achieve strategic objectivesManage customer relationships and interactions through all stages of the sales cycleWork with IoT Field Engineers to understand customer requirements and ensure customer satisfactionMaintain accurate data and forecasts within SalesforceEstablish productive professional relationships with key influencers and decision makersCoordinate with colleagues, including support, delivery and managementWhat we are looking for in youExceptional academic track record from both high school and universityUndergraduate degree in a technical subjectConfidence to respectfully speak up, exchange feedback, and share ideas without hesitationTrack record of going above-and-beyond expectations to achieve outstanding resultsField sales experience in embedded Linux, embedded software, or enterprise softwareTrack record of achievement of sales targets and large account winsPassion for technology evidenced by personal projects and initiativesThe work ethic and confidence to shine alongside motivated colleaguesProfessional written and spoken English with excellent presentation skillsExperience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred) Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountabilityAppreciative of diversity, polite and effective in a multi-cultural, multi-national organisationThoughtfulness and self-motivation Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments Ability to travel internationally twice a year, for company events up to two weeks longWillingness to travel up to 50% for customer meetings and industry eventsAbility to develop and execute territory sales plansDetail oriented with effective follow-upWhat we offer colleaguesWe consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide.

De gepatenteerde technologie van Reell wordt veel gebruikt in de consumentenelektronica, auto-industrie, vliegtuiginterieurs, medische technologie, werkstationmeubilair, kiosken/dataterminals en architecturale verlichtingsindustrieën. Ze staan bekend als een kwalitatief, hoogwaardig en betrouwbaar bedrijf.Daarnaast is Maatschappelijk Verantwoord Ondernemen één van de speerpunten van Reell.Zie ook hun websitehttps://reell.com/SolliciterenHerken jezelf in deze veelzijdige HR rol? Wil je graag jouw invulling geven aan HR binnen Reell Nederland en bijdragen aan groei? Zoek je parttime HR baan die er toe doet en in regio is?Dan zie ik graag je sollicitatie en motivatie tegemoet! Uiteraard beantwoord ik ook graag jouw vragen over deze vacature.FunctieomschrijvingWil jij als HR-generalist aan de slag bij een mooi bedrijf uit de maakindustrie bij jou in regio? Ben je op zoek naar die veelzijdige en afwisselende HR rol waar je veel vrijheid hebt en zelf verantwoordelijk bent voor HR binnen dit bedrijf?HR is en blijft een mooi vak, zeker als je daaraan je eigen invulling kan geven en dagelijks met veel facetten van HR bezig bent. Heb jij al enige jaren ervaring binnen het HR vakgebied en ben jij toe aan de volgende stap?Dan is de rol van HR-generalist (20-28 uur per week) bij Reell in Elsloo (Limburg) een mooie kans voor jou als HR professional om mee te bouwen aan dit bedrijf én je eigen ontwikkeling!Misschien ben je zonder dat je het wist, onderdelen van Reell tegen gekomen. Denk aan scharniersystemen van de elektrische achterklep van je auto zodat deze soepel en veilig open gaat. Of de midden arm steun in je auto die scharniert. Of de scharniersystemen in tandartsstoelen of het mechanisme van een pinautomaat. Dat doen ze met name voor wereldspelers als BMW, Audi, Tesla, Ford, Skoda, Mercedes, Bentley, Xerox, Kodak etc.Reell is een van oorsprong Amerikaans bedrijf, met vestigingen in Amerika, Azië, de EU (= Reell Nederland) en volgend jaar ook in Mexico.

Hierin vertaal je Amerikaans HR beleid door naar de Nederlandse situatie en adviseer je je HR collega’s over HR zaken in Nederland. Vanzelfsprekend is je Engels goed en ben je op je gemak als ‘schakel’ tussen de Amerikaanse en Nederlandse praktijk. Praktisch betekent dit ook dat je door het tijdsverschil met Amerika een aantal middagen werkt in deze parttime baan.Hoe ziet jouw dag er straks uit?Je ben het aanspreekpunt voor collega's met HR gerelateerde vragen en je zorgt voor een fijne werkomgeving voor alle collega's. Dat betekent bijvoorbeeld dat je uit je zelf ook de mensen (rond de 25 collega’s) opzoekt en weet hoe het met ze gaat. Je werft voor de vacatures en onderhoud het contact met de uitzendpartners. Daarnaast coördineer je de jaarlijkse beoordelingsgesprekken en ondersteunt de collega's bij het vinden van werk gerelateerde opleidingen. Je beheert de personeelsdossiers en functiebeschrijvingen. Reell valt onder de klein metaal cao. Ook het onboarden van nieuwe collega's behoort tot jouw takenpakket.

      "Job_Title": "Enterprise Open Source Sales Representative",
      "Company_Name": "Canonical",
      "Job_Location": "Beirut, Beirut Governorate, Lebanon Be among the first 25 applicants",
      "Job_Description": "Open source software is the new default in the enterprise, and Canonical is the new challenger to major enterprise software vendors.We deliver better open source from the data center to cloud and edge. Our Linux distribution Ubuntu is now the leading platform for public cloud compute, and the favorite platform for software engineers, data scientists and AI developers. Our mission is to accelerate the adoption and quality of open source globally, and our goal is to ship the most software on the planet by cores. A tidal wave of open source innovation is the next phase of the entire enterprise software industry, and we aim to be the most compelling way to ride that wave.Our customers include Global 500 enterprises and startups. We are expanding our product range from the base operating system - Ubuntu - to full enterprise solutions in infrastructure and applications. We can deliver software defined storage, private cloud solutions, container runtime environments, as well as databases, message queues, identity, observability, analytics, machine learning and web publishing capabilities. Customers love the idea that they can get security compliance and support for everything open source from a single company. Our goal is to have more solutions on tap than any other vendor, and we have built unique capabilities to make that possible across every cloud, every class of compute and every category of application.Canonical provides licensed enterprise software products, commercial support, managed services, consulting and training services to customers who are deploying Ubuntu or open source applications on the cloud, in their data center, or to the connected device and IoT ecosystem. We are just over 1,000 colleagues in 70+ countries and $250m in revenue, profitable, on a steady but relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote and ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not biggest, enterprise software company.We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a rush to find a position, it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long term advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world leading company we select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an environment which promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.In building our sales team, we look for five things:Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problemsHigh intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidencePassion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizesTeamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitionsEnergy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customersUbuntu is already very widely adopted which gives us a credible basis for conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable commercial relationships with the enterprises in their territory. Our product managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop the potential of your territory. You will need judgement as to which industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest. We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as clear, complete and continuous reporting on pipeline status and activity, using standard professional tools.The successful candidate will carry an annual bookings quota within their assigned territory. They should be able to travel regionally for client engagement, industry conferences, and internationally for company events twice a year. They will be expected to demonstrate professionalism and effectiveness, to prospect accounts for new business, maintain and develop existing relationships, and work with colleagues and partners on account strategy. They must be comfortable selling enterprise software, open source, cloud, virtualization, container technologies and technical software solutions to senior levels of the enterprise.Location: We are expanding our sales organisation globally and have open roles in every region.What your day will look likeRepresent the company, its solutions and software, in your territoryBuild and execute a territory plan to prioritize outreach and prospectingDevelop new pipeline through outreach, prospecting, local marketing, and industry eventsClose contracts to meet and exceed quarterly and annual bookings targetsBe mindful and proactive in achieving tactical and strategic objectivesManage customer relationships and interactions through all stages of the sales cycleWork with field engineers to propose solutions that solve our customers' business problemsWork with customer success to identify growth opportunitiesMaintain accurate pipeline data and forecasts within SalesforceEstablish productive professional relationships with key influencers and decision makersWhat we are looking for in youBachelor's level degree, preferably in engineering or computer scienceExperience of open source technology and solutionsDetail oriented with effective follow-upExperience in enterprise software or technology sales planning and executionTrack record of achievement in sales targets and new account winsSelf-discipline and motivation to be successful in a distributed teamProfessional written and spoken English, as well as any language that may be appropriate for your target marketAbility to travel for customer engagements, industry events and company eventsAdditional Skills Of InterestSpecific vertical experience, in particular finance, telco, health, energy, public sector, techExperience speaking at conferences or industry eventsWhat we offer youWe consider geographical location, experience, and performance when shaping compensation worldwide.

We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry.

We partner with the world's most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.But while classic, 'deb' based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be.

      "Job_Description": "Job DescriptionBackgroundCorruption undercuts countries’ efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It wastes valuable resources, reduces government effectiveness, erodes trust in public institutions, distorts markets, stifles innovation, deepens inequalities, damages the environment, and increases vulnerability to crises and conflicts. Driven by country priorities across the Arab states region and recognizing the critical importance of governance, which is one of UNDP’s “signature solutions” under its new Strategic Plan (2022-2025), UNDP adopted a regional approach to support and facilitate measurable progress towards transparency and accountability. This approach optimizes the use of scarce technical resources, enables agile and swift responses in a rapidly changing environment, mitigates risks of politicization and allows for accelerated and tailored exchanges of expertise among peers drawing on commonalities among the countries of the region.UNDP’s regional project on Anti-Corruption and Integrity in Arab Countries (ACIAC) contributes to the Strategic Plan’s “direction of change” including structural transformations, leaving no one behind, and building resilience by targeting the achievement of the three outputs outlined in this annual work plan. Related planned activities for 2024 are funded by the Government of the Republic of Korea. Primary recipients of the support are stakeholders across the region with a priority given to Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, and Tunisia. The regional team also provides support to additional countries through its advisory services to the various Country Offices in the Arab States region.In 2024, the focus of the regional project is on the inclusive and effective implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), including through policy and legislative support, training, and the provision of technologies and other tools to boost capacities of concerned institutions. It is also significantly expanding the work on transparency and accountability in key vulnerable sector, including through new research and the development and deployment of sectoral tools to identify, assess and mitigate risks of corruption.

      "Job_Location": "Beirut, Beirut Governorate, Lebanon 49 applicants",
      "Job_Description": "Job DescriptionBackgroundMore than 60 percent of the Arab region’s population is under the age of 30. Harnessing the energy of youth has the potential to build peace and stability and expand economic opportunities for them and their countries. However, unlocking these possibilities for young people requires partnership among all stakeholders, including youth themselves as well as a whole-of-society approach that widens participation and inclusion of youth in all aspects of life. In this age of complexity, the transition required is systemic and solutions need to be adaptable and holistic with a long-term vision. In response, UNDP has developed a shared agenda, a Regional Youth Project, SHABABEEK, to promote young people’s empowerment by building their capabilities and creating access to opportunities for engagement.Bringing together governments, private sector partners, civil society and young people, the Regional Youth Team works with 17 Country Offices in the Arab region, focusing on initiatives, projects and interventions directly supporting youth in the region under the two outcome areas of Economic, and Political and Civic Empowerment.As part of the project, a virtual space in the form of a digital platform, the NextGen Youth Platform, was created to bring together different elements of the youth innovation ecosystem. The platform bridges youths, national partners including youth serving organizations, donors, incubators, policymakers, academia, external stakeholders and individuals. The aim is to serve as a multi-functional platform that provides opportunities for networking, capacity building, knowledge exchange, resources and good practices to four identified pathways of youth, namely impact entrepreneurs, policy shapers, community builders and future-ready job seekers. Launched in January 2024, the platform also serves to track progress, showcase the work done by youth as well as by national partners. Each country has the opportunity to report on progresses made at the national level, provide activities’ updates, share announcements and exchange knowledge. In a nutshell, the platform aims to serve -a ‘one-stop-shop’ and for that it needs to be continuously updated and sustained.The objective of the internship will be to support the population, cleaning and update of various sections/features of the platform’s backend/frontend. The intern will particularly support the data entry and validation of profiles/projects in the backend, review and update content published on the platform and support the development of relevant communication material.Duties And ResponsibilitiesThe intern will be based in Beirut, Lebanon. Under the direct supervision of the Project and Research Analyst and overall supervision of the Regional Youth Project Manager, responsibilities may include, but will not be limited to, the following:Support the data entry, cleaning and validation of profiles/projects in the backend.Map events, trainings, announcements, publications, and any other opportunities of interest to youth in the Arab region. Map e-learning opportunities (manuals, webinars, courses, etc.) of interest to youth. Review the proposed dashboard summarizing website traffic to track website performance and collect visitor insights. Ensure the consistency and quality of all information posted on the platform as per specific request. Review translated material. Assist in organizing thematic focus groups. Assist in preparing Power Point Presentations.Follow-up on news stories related to youth in Arab countries and on content of other similar platforms on youth issues and challenges.
